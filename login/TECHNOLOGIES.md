# Testing Technologies for Interactive Educational Platform

Based on your acceptance criteria and need for an interactive learning platform, here's a recommended technology stack for each testing level:

## Unit Testing

- **Frontend**: 
  - **Jest** with React Testing Library - Can be executed via API calls and embedded in iframes
  - **Storybook** - For interactive component testing and visualization

- **Backend**:
  - **Jest** or **Mocha/Chai** - Can expose execution endpoints for remote triggering

## Integration Testing

- **API Testing**: 
  - **Cypress API Testing** or **Supertest** - Can test backend-database and frontend-backend interactions
  - **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** - For simulating API responses

## System/End-to-End Testing

- **Cypress** or **Playwright** - Both offer:
  - Programmable execution via API
  - Visual test runners that can be embedded
  - Test recordings and screenshots for learning
  - Detailed reporting capabilities

## Performance Testing

- **k6** by Grafana - JavaScript-based, easy to embed results
- **Lighthouse** - For frontend performance metrics

## Security Testing

- **OWASP ZAP** - Has API access for programmatic scanning
- **Snyk** - For dependency vulnerability scanning

## Integration Framework

- **GitHub Actions** or **CircleCI** - Create API endpoints that trigger test runs
- **Nx** for monorepo management and test orchestration

## Visualization Layer

- **Test reporting APIs** - Create custom endpoints that:
  1. Trigger specific test suites
  2. Return structured results
  3. Visualize them in your educational UI

- **Docker containers** - Isolate test environments for student interactions

## Implementation Strategy

1. Create a backend service that exposes REST endpoints to trigger different test types
2. Store test results in a database
3. Stream test execution progress via WebSockets to show real-time results
4. Create an embeddable iframe or web component that can be added to your educational site

This architecture allows students to trigger specific tests, observe execution, and analyze results interactively while learning about different testing methodologies.
